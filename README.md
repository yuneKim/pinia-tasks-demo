# pinia-task-demo

This application is for demoing Pinia features and to showcase what it can do.

# Issue

This application is using json database for the initial tasks sets and github pages doesn't support that.

Users cannot see the initial preloaded tasks when they open the page.

Need to fix this issue by using third party db api...
